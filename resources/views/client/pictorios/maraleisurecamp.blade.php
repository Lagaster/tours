                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        Set in what is considered Kenya’s prime wildlife area, Mara Leisure Camp is located along the Telek
                        River at the confluence of the Masai Mara’s four wildlife viewing areas on the Northern boundary of
                        the Masai Mara Game Reserve.
                    </p>

                        One of the most exciting spectacles in the world is the “Great Migration”, where two million
                        wildebeests, zebras and other herbivores pass through the Masai Mara / Serengeti ecosystem in Kenya
                        and Tanzania. This is a perilous journey for the animals, where they encounter many river crossings
                        and the gauntlet of crocodiles in waiting.
