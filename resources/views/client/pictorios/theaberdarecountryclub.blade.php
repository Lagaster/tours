                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        The aberdare country club, only a three-hour drive heading north-east from Nairobi is nestled on a
                        slope
                        of
                        Mwengai Hill in the Aberdare Highlands, part of the Great Rift Valley. This captivating site was
                        selected
                        with much emotion by an English couple who had decided to settle on the land of their choosing –
                        Kenya.
                        It
                        all happened many years ago: their children grew up there, but them moved on different places. After
                        almost
                        half a century, their home, “The Steep”, was sold and developed along the lines the original owner
                        would
                        not
                        have dreamed of, but was carefully nurtured and kept in a way they would have approved. This is
                        highlighted
                        in Monty Brown’s book, “Haven Under the Hill” so aptly:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        “Today despite the fast- changing tempo of the outside world, the old home still retains that
                        comfortable,
                        solid feeling based on traditions from a time when life proceeded at a far more leisurely and gentle
                        pace”.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        The Club’s 1,300-acre wildfire sanctuary is teeming with impalas, zebras, giraffes and the more
                        reclusive
                        leopards. It is haven of unhurried charm set in a garden bursting with a profusion of color and with
                        peacocks living within the lush green lawns.

                        Game drives to the Solio Ranch, a private sanctuary between the spurs of the Aberdare Mountains and
                        Mt. Kenya are possible too. This 25,000-hectare reserve became famous because of its unique success
                        in the rearing of the White Rhino and Black Rhino. Lion, leopards, cheetahs, buffaloes and zebras
                        can also be viewed here in great numbers.
