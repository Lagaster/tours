                                The clue is in the name here! We donâ€™t have many of these but they are often based on
                                physical challenges such as climbing a peak, with several hours of physical activity per
                                day,sometimes in difficult conditions. Physical fitness and preparation is required for
                                these andthe experience can be intense. The rewards however fully justify the effort!

                            A Level the tour combines all the elements of previous itineraries, but includes climbing a
                            glaciated mountain peak. Specialist pieces of equipment like ice axes and crampons will be
                            needed, and you should have experience of using them. Please check the trip notes carefully
                            to ensure that your experience and equipment meets the demands of a Tough+ trip. When
                            climbing, the peak days can be very long and you may be on your feet for 11 hours or more.
