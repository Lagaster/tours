                                Challenging trips are much more taxing (most of the best adventures are!) In addition to
                                a faster-paced itinerary, there’ll be less downtime and likely a more demanding climate.
                                Children and teenagers taking on challenging trips should be willing to take part in
                                several hours of activity a day. If your youngsters are happy outdoors, excited by a
                                challenge and don’t mind ‘roughing it’ on occasion, then this grade is for them.

                            Fitness is important at this grade, which compares to extended walking in mountainous
                            terrain such as the Lakes or Snowdonia. High altitudes, climate and remoteness can also play
                            a part. Previous trekking experience is desirable, but not vital if you are confident of
                            your physical condition. Walking days are usually between six and eight hours, although they
                            may be longer for passes or peaks. Daily ascents will likely be around 900m to 1000m,
                            perhaps with the odd day ascending around 1100m to 1200m.
