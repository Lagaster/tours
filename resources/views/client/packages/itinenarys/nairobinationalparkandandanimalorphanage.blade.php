                    You will be picked at the agreed pick-up point early in the morning and arrive at Nairobi National
                    park one or two hours later. Check in and begin the game drive with a professional guide/ driver.
                    The game drive will continue for about two hours.

                        Have a rest at the Kingfisher picnic site for about thirty minutes where a qualified
                        photographer on board will capture those moments. The family can also take photos using their
                        phones or cameras at the picnic site and throughout the trip.

                    Continue the game drive for about two hours as you head to the exit. Watch out for buffalos, rhinos,
                    lions, zebras, and many other wilder animals. Visit one of the few human-made dams inside the
                    reserve to look for crocodiles and hippos. You will also have the chance of spotting aquatic birds,
                    waterbucks and other animals that stay on and around water bodies.
